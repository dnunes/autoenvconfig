AutoEnvConfig
=============
### Environment config that Just Worksâ„¢!

Stop worrying about the hassle of **loading environment config files everywhere**, **config files with missing entries** or **schemas that gets old when you forget to add a new config key to it**.

**AutoEnvConfig** is a fully-tested* no-nonsense no-dependencies package to help you keep your ever expanding project under control. _*(bear with me on the beta features)_

**AutoEnvConfig** was designed with simple but very powerful goals:

* **Blazingly fast**: it caches everything it can, loads your files only once and check your schema on load, not on usage;
* **No extra configuration needed**: this package follows the idea of _convention over configuration_, so it keeps the required environment files to a minimum and there is nothing to thinker with before start using it;
* **Never out of sync**: when loading the environment configuration file, it checks the schema for *missing* or *extra* keys, alerting you when you are missing some key in your config or in your schema file;
* **Auto load of the right config file**: you can set the root path of the project in the environment config file and it will load automatically;
* **Possible local [eventual persistence](#eventualpersistence)** (beta): you can overwrite data by code and have it persisted across restarts (or even deploys!) whenever needed. Things like general settings' dashboard for a small project gets really fast and easy (look, ma!, no databases!). You can backup your persistence file whenever you need or simply merge it with your env config periodically to make changes definitive.

To use it right away, [npm install it](#installation) and follow the super simple [Quick Start Guide](#quickstart).

For more details, check out the [Conventions](#conventions) and [Public Methods API](#methods).


## <a id="installation">Installation</a>
The simplest way to install this package is using [npm](http://www.npmjs.com/):
```bash
$ npm i AutoEnvConfig
```

You can also manually download any release from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dnunes/autoenvconfig/) on the [releases page](https://github.com/dnunes/autoenvconfig/releases/) or try the [latest stable source](https://github.com/dnunes/autoenvconfig/zipball/master). The links and info are also available on [the project page](http://dnunes.com/autoenvconfig/).


## <a id="quickstart">Quick Start Guide</a>

There are just four steps needed to start using this package:

1. Create a folder named `envs` on your project's root;
2. Create a [`config.schema`](#sampleschema) file with your schema;
3. Create a [`ENVNAME.json`](#sampleenv) file for your environments with their specific configuration (where `ENVNAME` is whatever name you wish to use);
4. Load the package. Done.

In your code:

```javascript
const AutoEnvConfig = require('autoenvconfig');

let isValuePresent = AutoEnvConfig.has('deep.key.supported'));
if (isValuePresent) {
  let valueFromConfig = AutoEnvConfig.get('deep.key.supported'));
  console.log(valueFromConfig); //"myValue"
}

let itDoesDefaults = AutoEnvConfig.get('invalid.key', 'default');
console.log(itDoesDefaults); //"default"
```

### <a id="magicload">Magic Loading</a>

One of the nicest features of the package is that you don't need to specify the environment, as it will magicly detect and load the correct file based on some values. This auto generated instance is called [_magic instance_](#magicload).

For the magic load to happen, your [`config.schema`](#sampleschema) and [`ENVNAME.json`](#sampleenv) files must have a `_path` key with the path of your project's root. It will find the correct environment checking this value by default. You can, however, safely ignore this convention and manually specify the file name if needed.

### <a id="magicload">Schema and Environment File formats</a>
The schema and environment config files are simple JSON files. The only limit for the _keys_ is the dot character ("`.`") which is forbidden (because it is used as a separator when loading), but I suggest you to limit your keys to alphanumeric chars for simplicity.

In the schema files, every key _MUST_ be prefixed with either `#` or `?`, indicating mandatory or optional key, respectively.


## <a id="samples">Sample Files</a>

### <a id="sampleschema">Sample config.schema</a>
```json
{
  "# _path": "",

  "# id": "",
  "# envtype": "",

  "# requiredKey": "",
  "? deep": {
    "? key": {
      "# supported": "myValue",
      "? asWell": "otherValue"
    }
  }
}
```

You can have a required key inside an optional object (in this sample, the `supported` required key is inside optional `deep` and `key` objects), so that you can omit the whole object (it will use the defaults), but if it exists in the environment config file, it must include at least these required keys.

### <a id="sampleenv">Sample ENVNAME.json</a>
```json
{
  "_path": "/home/dnunes/code/node/autoenvconfig",

  "id": "dev",
  "envtype": "local",

  "requiredKey": "value"
}
```


## <a id="eventualpersistence">Eventual Persistence</a>

If you need to overwrite some settings through code you can use [`AutoEnvConfig.set(<key>, <value>))`](#mautoset) method (or its [instance counterpart](#minsset)). This change will not survive restarts or new deploys, though. For any time you need to have something persisted across local restarts or even deploys, you can now use [`AutoEnvConfig.persist(<key>, <value>))`](#mautoper) and it will be loaded automatically on the next run/instance creation.

The persistence file defaults to the path `envs/ENVNAME.persist.json` but you can freely configure it using the `_persistFile` key in your [`ENVNAME.json`](#sampleenv). The path resolution defaults to the root of your project, so a value of `custom.persist.json` for the `_persistFile` key would create the persistence file in your project's root folder.

To avoid filling your I/O with multiple writes to disk, it will only persist the data periodically and efficiently using a _minimum interval_ setting and _dirty detection_ logic, so it's safe to call persist methods multiples times a second with no impact on performance whatsoever. An even improved logic suitable for eventual bursts in settings will be implemented in the future.


## <a id="methods">Methods</a>

All the methods can be called in a specific instance (from a `AutoEnvConfig.load` call) or in the [_magic instance_](#magicload). You can save a reference for the [_magic instance_](#magicload) using a `AutoEnvConfig.load()` call and call methods on this instance as well and it will work exactly the same as calling the methods directly on the package. The only exception is the "AutoEnvConfig.enablePersistence()" and "AutoEnvConfig.disablePersistence()"

### <a id="magicmethods">Magic Methods</a>

- <a id="mautoload">`AutoEnvConfig.load([envName [, forceNew = false]])`</a>
This method will return a new instance of `AutoEnvConfig`. If you ommit the `[envName]` parameter, it will try to [_magic load_](#magicload) the right env file. If you pass the `[envName]` parameter, it will just return the config for the specified env. It returns false if it cannot find a suitable environment config.
If `[forceNew]` is `false`, it will reuse the first instance for the same `[envName]` created before.

- <a id="mautoget">`AutoEnvConfig.get(<key>[, defaultValueIfNotPresent])`</a>
This method runs [`<Instance>.get(<key>[, defaultValueIfNotPresent])`](#minsget) on the [_magic instance_](#magicload).

- <a id="mautohas">`AutoEnvConfig.has(<key>)`</a>
This method runs [`<Instance>.has(<key>)`](#minshas) on the [_magic instance_](#magicload).

- <a id="mautoset">`AutoEnvConfig.set(<key>, <value>)`</a>
This method runs [`<Instance>.set(<key>, <value>))`](#minsset) on the [_magic instance_](#magicload).

- <a id="mautoenable">`AutoEnvConfig.enablePersistence([minInterval = 120[, affectMagic = true]])`</a>
This method set persistence global setting to _on_. It will affect all new instances created after setting it.
You can set the minimum interval between disk writes using the `[minInterval]` parameter.
If `[affectMagic]` is `true`, it will also enable persistence on the current [_magic instance_](#magicload), if any.

- <a id="mautodisable">`AutoEnvConfig.disablePersistence([affectMagic = true])`</a>
This method set persistence global setting to _off_. It will affect all new instances created after setting it. If `[affectMagic]` is `true`, it will also disable persistence on the current [_magic instance_](#magicload), if any.

- <a id="mautoper">`AutoEnvConfig.persist(<key>, <value>)`</a>
This method runs [`<Instance>.persist(<key>, <value>))`](#minsper) on a [_magic instance_](#magicload).

### <a id="instancemethods">Instance Methods</a>

- <a id="minsload">`<Instance>.load([envName [, forceNew = false]])`</a>
The same as [`AutoEnvConfig.load([envName [, forceNew = false]])`](#mautoload).

- <a id="minsget">`<Instance>.get(<key>[, defaultValueIfNotPresent])`</a>
This method will return the value of `<key>` in the `<Instance>` object. If `<key>` is not present in the `<Instance>` object, it will either return `[defaultValueIfNotPresent]` or throw an error if there the default value parameter was ommitted.

-  <a id="minshas">`<Instance>.has(<key>)`</a>
This method will return `true` if the `<key>` is present in the `<Instance>` object or `false` if not.

- <a id="minsset">`<Instance>.set(<key>, <value>)`</a>
This method will replace the in-memory contents of `<key>` for the `<Instance>` object with `<value>`.

- <a id="minsper">`<Instance>.persist(<key>, <value>)`</a>
This method will replace the in-memory contents of `<key>` for the `<Instance>` object with `<value>` and will [eventually persist](#eventualpersistence) it on disk.

- <a id="minsenable">`<Instance>.enablePersistence([minInterval = 120[, overrideMemory = true]])`</a>
This method enables persistence on `<Instance>`.
You can set the minimum interval between disk writes using the `[minInterval]` parameter.
If `overrideMemory` is `true`, it will also merge the in-memory config with the data loaded from the persistence file at the time persistence is enabled. It will load the persistence file on instance creation if [global persistence](#mautoenable) setting in _on_.

- <a id="minsdisable">`<Instance>.disablePersistence()`</a>
This method disables persistence on `<Instace>`.


## <a id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</a>

You can override the default file and bypass the environment file search routine by calling the `load` method:
```javascript
//will load envs/other.json
AutoEnvConfig = require('autoenvconfig').load('other');
AutoEnvConfig.get('key.in.other.file');
```

You can also load multiple configs if ever needed:
```javascript
AutoEnvConfig = require('autoenvconfig');

//load the right env based on "_path" config value
let rightConfig = AutoEnvConfig.load();
rightConfig.get('key.in.right.file');

//load "envs/other.json"
let otherConfig = AutoEnvConfig.load('other');
otherConfig.get('key.in.other.file');

//load "envs/oneMore.json"
let oneMoreConfig = rightConfig.load('oneMore.json');
oneMoreConfig.get('key.in.onemore.file');
```
Note that you can call `load` directly on the package or on any `AutoEnvConfig` object returned by the `load` method.
